# Ubuntu-IceWM
Welcome To Ubuntu IceWM Its Very Lighter For Very Old Hardware
What Is Ubuntu IceWM
Its Lightweight Ubuntu Flavor That Make Your Old Computer Back To Life
Ubuntu IceWM Is Lighter Than Ubuntu LXDE Because IceWM is a window manager only, while LXDE is a full desktop environment with additional components (panel, session manager, file manager). This means IceWM consumes fewer resources, especially RAM and CPU, though LXDE offers a more complete desktop experience.

Resource Usage Comparison
Setup	Idle RAM Usage	CPU Load (Idle)	Disk Footprint	Components
Ubuntu LXDE	~120 MB	Very low (<2%)	Larger (includes lxpanel, lxsession, PCManFM, etc.)	Full desktop environment
Ubuntu IceWM	~60–80 MB	Extremely low (<1%)	Smaller (only window manager + basic panel/taskbar)	Window manager only

Why IceWM Is Lighter

    Scope difference: LXDE bundles multiple utilities (panel, session manager, file manager), while IceWM focuses purely on window management.

    Memory footprint: LXDE’s extra components add overhead, whereas IceWM stays minimal.

    Disk usage: LXDE pulls in more packages, IceWM remains lean.

Trade-Offs

    LXDE advantages:

        Provides a familiar desktop environment with integrated tools.

        Easier for beginners who want a “ready-to-use” desktop.

        Better suited for users who want a lightweight but complete desktop experience.

    IceWM advantages:

        Maximum performance and minimal resource usage.

        Ideal for very old or resource-constrained hardware.

        Highly customizable via config files, though less user-friendly out of the box.
